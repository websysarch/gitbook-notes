[Leet Code #3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

### Problem

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
* `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
