### System Design&#x20;

The platform is basically built with

* Microservices
* Micro FrontEnds
* Micro sites
* Third party applications

#### Front End Eco System

* Design System (named Swan, earlier Visage) implemented in React and vanilla
* Common used functionality are created as NPM packages eg. Search, Site Header & Footers, Forms, etc.
* Micro-sites are basically single page (in some cases 2-3 pages) developed using Gatsby, Next or CRA.
* Micro-frontends are developed using a plugin systems, internally called UX-Mods. Each UX Mod Page will have a registry, where a Mod will get registered with a location where it will be loaded and the condition when it should be loaded. (Eg. On Cart page, a product renderer UX Mod registered for a category of product)
* Each of there page are hosted independently and a URL service is used to expose it as a coherent URL. This allows marketing teams to use whatever products they want. This acts more like a Reverse proxy server, where the configurations are generated via templates.
* All pages are built using Gitlab CICD platform and hosted to AWS. Each project with custom domain names, with (production, sandbox and feature deployments)
