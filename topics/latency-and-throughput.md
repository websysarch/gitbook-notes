# Latency and Throughput

For measuring performance these two are very important

### Definitions

#### Latency

How much time does it take to perform a single task.

* how much time will it take for the API to save the user data in the database?
* How much time will it take to read a single file from the file system?

#### Throughput

How many tasks can be performed in a given time unit.

* How many users can be saved in the database in a minute.
* How many files can be read in a second.
