# C10K

The C10k problem is **the problem of optimizing network sockets to handle a large number of clients at the same time**. The name C10k is a numeronym for concurrently handling ten thousand connections.

This problem was solved by **fixing OS kernels and moving away from threaded servers like Apache to event-driven servers like Nginx and Node**.
