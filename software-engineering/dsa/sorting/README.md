# Sorting

### Features of Algorithms

#### Parameters to evaluate a sorting algorithm

| Features           | Notes                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time Complexity    |                                                                                 |
| Spacial Complexity |                                                                                 |
| Stability          | If two values are equal for sorting comparisons, their order must be preserved. |

#### Time & Space Complexity

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Bubble Sort    | Square          | constant         |
| Selection Sort | Square          | constant         |
| Insertion Sort | Square          | constant         |

### Selection Sort

* Select the min number (assuming asc) from the unsorted part, and put it in the correct place

### Bubble Sort

* Keep moving the max number (assuming asc), to the max index with each iteration. Stop the loop, in case no movement in done in a pass.

### Insertion Sort

*
